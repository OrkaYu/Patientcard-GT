Crucially, there is a significant deterioration in the right ear Word Recognition Score (from 88% to 56%), while the left ear remains stable. Tympanometry is normal bilaterally. Acoustic reflexes are absent at higher frequencies, consistent with the hearing loss, and decay is negative. The findings raise concern for retrocochlear pathology.",
