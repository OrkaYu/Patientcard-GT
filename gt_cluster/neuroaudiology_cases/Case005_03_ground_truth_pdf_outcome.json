Peripheral hearing sensitivity and speech recognition are normal bilaterally. The ABR shows only a subtle prolongation of the I-III interval on the right, consistent with the extra-axial location of the tumor distant from the brainstem. However, central auditory processing is significantly impaired, as evidenced by poor bilateral performance on the frequency pattern test, likely due to the effects of hydrocephalus on cerebral auditory structures.",
