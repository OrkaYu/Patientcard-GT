Central auditory testing revealed that dichotic listening and degraded speech perception were normal and unaffected by the surgery. However, frequency pattern recognition was abnormal bilaterally at baseline and remained so post-operatively, suggesting a pre-existing deficit related to the seizure disorder rather than a surgical effect. The stability of the central test results confirms that the anterior section of the corpus callosum does not contain the primary auditory interhemispheric fibers.",
