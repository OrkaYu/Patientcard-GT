Pure tone testing shows a severe low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss on the right, with a notable inability to track ascending thresholds, suggesting central disruption of attentional mechanisms. Speech recognition is extremely poor and disproportionate to thresholds. Bekesy audiometry indicates significant tone decay. ABR results confirm brainstem involvement with absent late waves on the right and distorted waves on the left. Imaging confirms a large right vertebral artery aneurysm compressing the pons.",
