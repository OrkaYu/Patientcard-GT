Central testing revealed a classic 'left ear extinction' pattern on dichotic tasks (Rhyme and CVs), consistent with a lesion of the posterior corpus callosum preventing transfer of right-hemisphere input to the language-dominant left hemisphere. Duration patterns were abnormal bilaterally, indicating a deficit in temporal sequencing/transfer. Dichotic digits showed less suppression than other stimuli, possibly due to different transfer pathways or cross-cueing.",
