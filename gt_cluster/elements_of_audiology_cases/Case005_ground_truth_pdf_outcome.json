This asymmetry is consistent with the acoustic shadow effect from shooting a rifle right-handed. Middle ear function is normal. Retrocochlear pathology is ruled out by negative tone decay, absent TEOAEs (consistent with cochlear loss), and ABR results showing a cochlear pattern (steep latency-intensity function).
