    "Validate that your difficulty in noise is real, even though the standard hearing test doesn't show a loss.",

    "Suggest communication strategies: face the speaker, ensure good lighting, and try to position yourself away from noise sources (like speakers or kitchen areas) at parties.",
    "Mention that anxiety or stress can sometimes make these listening situations harder.",
