    "The hearing loss is likely temporary and treatable, but medical management is required.",
    "We need to refer you to an otologist (ENT) for evaluation and treatment.",
    "It is crucial to return for a complete hearing test, including bone conduction, after medical treatment is completed to ensure hearing has returned to normal.",

    "The father in the scenario has his own hearing loss (noise-induced from artillery) and tinnitus, but this is irrelevant to the child's genetic history.",
    "The child tired quickly during testing, so the actor playing the clinician should emphasize the need for efficiency or breaks.",
    "Parents may be confused about why the child was treated for tonsillitis if the issue is fluid in the ears."
