The audiometric profile, combined with the family history and physical finding of blue sclera, is strongly consistent with bilateral otosclerosis.",

    "Your hearing loss is 'conductive,' meaning sound is being blocked from reaching the inner ear efficiently, likely due to stiffness in the middle ear bones.",
