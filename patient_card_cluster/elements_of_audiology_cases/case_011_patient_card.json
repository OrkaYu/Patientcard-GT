Furthermore, objective measures including normal acoustic reflexes, present TEOAEs, and ABR Wave V thresholds within normal limits (15/20 dB nHL) confirm normal physiological hearing sensitivity bilaterally.",

    "Avoid accusatory language; accept responsibility for potential 'misunderstanding' of instructions to allow the patient a graceful way to improve behavioral responses.",
