However, all objective measures—including tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, ABR, and TEOAEs—are completely normal. The discrepancy between the air-conduction thresholds and the normal physiological measures (especially OAEs and reflexes) suggests the hearing loss is artifactual, likely caused by collapsing ear canals under the pressure of supra-aural headphones.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your daughter has normal hearing in both ears.",
    "The 'hearing loss' seen on the school screenings and the initial graph was caused by the headphones pushing her soft ear canals closed (collapsing canals), blocking the sound.",
    "We confirmed her hearing is normal using tests that don't put pressure on the ear (like the echo test/OAEs) and by looking at her bone conduction responses.",
    "She does not need medical treatment or hearing aids. We will provide a letter for her school and doctor explaining these findings."

    "If playing the parent, express confusion about why the school keeps failing her and why the previous doctor couldn't find anything wrong.",
