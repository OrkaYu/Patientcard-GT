  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient presents with normal bilateral hearing sensitivity, excellent speech recognition in quiet, normal tympanometry, normal ABR, and present OAEs. However, there is a specific finding of absent contralateral acoustic reflexes bilaterally, despite normal ipsilateral reflexes. This pattern, combined with complaints of difficulty in noise, suggests a possible central auditory processing disorder or retrocochlear pathology affecting the crossover pathways.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your standard hearing test results are excellent, showing you can hear very soft sounds and understand speech clearly in quiet environments.",
    "However, we found a specific irregularity in your acoustic reflex test (the muscle reaction to loud sounds). While the reflex works when sound and measurement are on the same side, it is absent when crossing from one ear to the other.",
    "This finding, combined with your difficulty hearing in noise, suggests the problem may be located in the pathways connecting your ears within the brainstem, rather than in the ears themselves.",
    "We recommend further specialized testing for central auditory processing disorders to better understand how your brain handles complex sound environments.",
    "A referral to a neurologist is also recommended to rule out any medical issues affecting these auditory pathways."

    "You should emphasize that if you concentrate very hard, you can understand better, but it is fatiguing.",
