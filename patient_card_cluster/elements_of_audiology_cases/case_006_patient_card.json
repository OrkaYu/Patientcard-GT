The sensorineural component is mild to moderate in the high frequencies.

ABR results support a conductive etiology (prolonged absolute latencies with normal interpeaks).",

    "Your hearing test shows a 'mixed' hearing loss, meaning there is a problem with how sound gets to the inner ear (conductive) and a smaller issue with the inner ear itself.",
    "The good news is your ability to understand speech is excellent when sounds are loud enough.",
    "The strong odor and drainage you described are concerning for an active infection or cholesteatoma. It is critical that you see an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist (Otologist) for a second opinion immediately.",
    "Contrary to what you were told, there are options to help you hear. If the drainage persists, we can consider a bone-conduction hearing aid, which bypasses the ear canal entirely and won't be damaged by drainage.",
