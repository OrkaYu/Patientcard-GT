Testing indicates the presence of cochlear dead regions at 8 and 10 kHz. His current open-fit amplification provides limited high-frequency audibility (undershooting targets above 1.5-2 kHz) and poor speech-in-noise performance compared to norms, likely due to the acoustic limitations of open domes for this degree of high-frequency loss.",

    "Your hearing is normal in the low pitches but drops off sharply in the high pitches, which is why you hear people talking but struggle to understand the clarity, especially in noise.",
    "We found 'dead regions' in the very high pitches (8000 Hz and above), meaning the nerve cells there may not process sound effectively even when amplified.",
    "Your current open-fit hearing aids are comfortable, but they let the high-pitch sounds leak out, making it hard to give you the volume you need for clarity without feedback.",
    "Because you found closed ear molds uncomfortable in the past, we are exploring a light-driven device (Earlens) that might provide the necessary high-pitch amplification without the plugged-up feeling."
