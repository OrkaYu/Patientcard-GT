Speech testing in the right ear shows 'rollover,' meaning clarity gets significantly worse as volume increases (dropping from 68% to 16%). Vestibular testing indicates a severe (83%) weakness of the right balance system and postural instability. Together with absent acoustic reflexes on the right, these findings strongly suggest retrocochlear pathology (an issue with the auditory/vestibular nerve) rather than a cochlear problem.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test confirms hearing loss in the right ear, but more importantly, we found that making speech louder actually makes it harder for you to understand in that ear.",
    "The balance tests show your right inner ear balance system is 83% weaker than the left, which explains your dizziness and unsteadiness.",
    "These findings—the specific type of hearing difficulty and the balance weakness—suggest the problem is located on the nerve connecting the ear to the brain.",
    "Because of these results and your facial weakness, it is critical that you return to your ENT doctor immediately. They have ordered an MRI to look at the nerve, which is the necessary next step."
