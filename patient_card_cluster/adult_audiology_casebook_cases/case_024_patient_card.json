Vestibular evaluation reveals a 'double hit' pathology: a peripheral left vestibular hypofunction (likely from a prior neuritis) and central vestibular impairment characterized by downbeat nystagmus, abnormal pursuit, and failure of VOR suppression. The central findings correlate with MRI-confirmed cerebellar atrophy, likely associated with long-term alcohol use, which is inhibiting compensation for the peripheral loss.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test shows a mild hearing loss in the low pitches, but your ability to understand speech remains excellent.",
    "Your dizziness has two causes: a weakness in your left inner ear (likely from the severe episode 6 years ago) and a processing issue in the balance center of your brain (cerebellum).",
    "The 'processing' part of your brain is having trouble compensating for the inner ear weakness, which is why you still feel unsteady.",
    "The MRI shows some shrinkage in the cerebellum, which is often related to long-term alcohol use. Reducing or stopping alcohol is critical to prevent further damage.",
    "Because of your unsteadiness, fall prevention and safety in the home are very important priorities."
  ],
  "notes_for_actor": [
    "Portray a subtle speech abnormality: 'scanning speech' where you pause slightly between syllables or words.",
    "You should appear unsteady when standing or walking, but you can sit comfortably.",
    "Be honest about the alcohol use (12 drinks a weekend) but perhaps view it as 'normal' or 'moderate' until counseled otherwise.",
    "You are frustrated that your balance has been getting worse despite seeing other doctors previously."
