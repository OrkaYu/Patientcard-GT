While standard hearing aid programming provided audibility for speech matching NAL-NL1 targets, the patient experienced significant distortion when playing the tambourine. This was identified as 'front-end' distortion, where the high peak input level of the percussion instrument (110 dB SPL) exceeded the dynamic range of the hearing aid's analog-to-digital converter.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing loss is concentrated in the high frequencies, which affects clarity, but your ability to understand speech remains excellent when it is loud enough.",
    "The distortion you hear with the tambourine is not because the hearing aid is 'broken', but because the instrument's volume spike (peak input) is too loud for the hearing aid's digital entrance (A/D converter).",
    "Think of the hearing aid input like a doorway; the tambourine is too tall to fit through without hitting its head (clipping/distortion).",
    "We need to use specific technology for your music: either a device with a higher input ceiling or a microphone setting that reduces sensitivity to prevent this 'front-end' clipping.",
    "Continue to use hearing protection during high-volume performances to preserve your remaining hearing."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "You are a knowledgeable musician; you understand sound levels and use a sound level meter.",
    "You are initially skeptical of the hearing aids during the fitting because the tambourine sounds terrible—describe it as 'fuzzy' or 'distorted'.",
    "You are not complaining about loudness, but about quality/clarity of the music.",
    "You are motivated to hear better but will not accept a device that ruins the sound of your music."
