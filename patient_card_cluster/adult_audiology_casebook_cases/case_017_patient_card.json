  "overall_audiologic_summary": "A 23-year-old asymptomatic female research volunteer presents with normal hearing (screening pass at 20 dB HL, 250-8000 Hz) and normal DPOAE amplitudes bilaterally. No traditional spontaneous OAEs were detected. A unique physiologic phenomenon was discovered: transient, broadband noise floor modulations ('spikes') in the ear canal, measuring 42.35 ± 5.58 dB SPL (max ~50 dB SPL) with interspike intervals of 35-75 seconds. The spikes are bilateral (R > L amplitude), audible via Toynbee stethoscope but inaudible to the patient. Extensive testing ruled out: PETD, saccade-induced TM movement, intracranial pressure changes, jaw musculature, myoclonus/tremor, paragangliomas, and equipment malfunction. The phenomenon is modulated by neck pressure (reduces amplitude) and exercise (increases frequency). The source remains unknown but may involve physiologic filtering mechanisms being activated by internal body noise.",
