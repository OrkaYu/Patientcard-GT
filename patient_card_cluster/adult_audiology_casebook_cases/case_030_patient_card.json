Vestibular testing reveals a dissociation between low-frequency and high-frequency vestibular function: caloric testing (low frequency) shows a significant 42% left unilateral weakness, while vHIT (high frequency) is normal. This pattern, along with the phase lead on rotary chair and normal VEMPs, is consistent with 'definite' Meniere's disease affecting the low-frequency spectrum of the peripheral vestibular system.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test confirms a hearing loss in the left ear that matches your report of fluctuation, and the clarity of speech in that ear is significantly reduced.",
    "The balance testing shows a weakness in the left inner ear's balance system, specifically in the lower frequency range (detected by the water test), while the higher frequency range (head impulse test) remains normal.",
    "This pattern of results—hearing loss combined with specific balance test findings—is consistent with Meniere's disease.",
