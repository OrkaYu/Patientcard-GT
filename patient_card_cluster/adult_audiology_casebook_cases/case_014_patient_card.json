Standard hearing aids provided insufficient benefit in noise, necessitating the addition of an FM system.",

    "Your hearing test results show a specific condition called Auditory Dyssynchrony (or Neuropathy). This means your inner ear detects sound well, but the signal becomes disorganized as it travels along the hearing nerve to the brain.",
    "This explains why you can hear sounds (volume) but struggle to understand clarity, especially in background noise.",
    "Standard hearing aids make sounds louder, which helps in quiet, but they cannot fully correct the timing/clarity issue in noise.",
    "To help you in classrooms and social settings, we are adding an FM system. This device picks up the speaker's voice and sends it directly to your hearing aids, bypassing the background noise.",

    "Show relief when the FM system is introduced and you finally experience clarity in noise."
