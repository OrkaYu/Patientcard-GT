Speech recognition is excellent (100%) in quiet. While pure-tone thresholds are largely normal, DPOAE testing reveals reduced amplitudes in the high frequencies (4-8 kHz range), particularly in the left ear, suggesting early outer hair cell dysfunction consistent with noise exposure before it is fully evident on the audiogram.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test shows normal hearing in the right ear, but a small 'notch' in the left ear at a high pitch, which is a classic sign of early noise damage.",
    "The 'buzzing' (tinnitus) you experience after headphone use is a warning sign from your ears that they are being overexposed.",
    "Even though you hear well now, the specialized tests (OAEs) show some strain on the hair cells in your inner ear.",
    "As a Zumba instructor, you are at high risk. We recommend high-fidelity 'musician's earplugs' which lower the volume without muffling the music or your voice.",
    "It is crucial to wear hearing protection during every class to prevent this notch from deepening or spreading to other pitches."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "You are a fit, healthy 27-year-old Zumba instructor.",
    "You are generally positive and cooperative but initially don't feel you have a 'problem' because you hear fine in daily life.",
    "You might be skeptical that you need earplugs because you need to hear the music beat and your students clearly.",
    "You admit to using headphones for long periods and feeling a 'buzz' afterwards, but you've dismissed it as temporary until now."
