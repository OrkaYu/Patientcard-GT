Crucially, objective DPOAE testing revealed robust emissions in the speech frequencies, indicating normal cochlear function, and unmasked bone conduction testing showed a lack of cross-hearing that is physiologically impossible.",

    "The results of our objective tests, specifically the otoacoustic emissions, are very encouraging.",

    "Because the inner ear is functioning normally, the hearing loss you are experiencing does not appear to be caused by permanent damage to the ear organ itself.",
