    "Your symptoms are caused by a small thinning or opening in the bone over one of your balance canals (the superior canal). This creates a 'third window' in the inner ear.",
    "This opening allows sound and pressure to leak into the balance system, which explains why loud noises or straining make you dizzy.",
    "It also lets internal sounds (like your voice or eye movements) vibrate the ear more than usual, which is why you hear them so loudly (autophony).",
    "The hearing loss on your left side is not due to a problem with the ear canal or middle ear bones, but rather this leak of energy in the inner ear.",
    "Treatment options range from avoiding triggers (loud sounds) to surgical repair (plugging or resurfacing the canal) depending on how much this affects your quality of life."
