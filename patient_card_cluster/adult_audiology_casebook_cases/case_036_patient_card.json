    "Your hearing test shows a significant difference between your ears, which is a 'red flag' requiring medical investigation.",
    "The MRI results confirm a growth (vestibular schwannoma) on the hearing nerve of your left ear, which explains the dizziness and rapid hearing drop.",
    "We need to refer you to a neurotologist to discuss management options like surgery or radiation.",

    "In later encounters, after the medical scare and failed appointment, become more cooperative and open about your symptoms.",
    "Portray the dizziness as a heavy, pressure-headed sensation that makes walking difficult."
