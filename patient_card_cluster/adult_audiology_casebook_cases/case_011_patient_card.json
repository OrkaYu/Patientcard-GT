  "overall_audiologic_summary": "Peripheral hearing sensitivity is essentially normal (mild loss only at 8 kHz), and speech recognition in quiet is excellent (100%). However, comprehensive APD testing reveals significant deficits in auditory integration (dichotic listening) and speech understanding in noise (W-22 in noise, SCAN-3A Figure-Ground). Temporal processing and phonological synthesis abilities are intact. The profile is consistent with an Auditory Processing Disorder affecting integration and figure-ground skills.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your standard hearing test is normal, which is why hearing aids made things louder but not clearer.",
    "The testing shows you have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Your brain struggles to separate speech from background noise and to integrate information from both ears.",
    "This is likely a long-standing issue that you were able to compensate for until work demands increased.",
    "Since hearing aids are not the solution, we need to focus on auditory training and strategies to help your brain process sound more efficiently."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "Portray frustration with the medical system; you have seen multiple doctors who told you 'nothing is wrong' while you struggle daily.",
    "Emphasize that hearing aids were annoying—they amplified the noise you hate.",
