    "We recommend Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) principles, using sound therapy to help your brain habituate to the tinnitus.",
    "Since hearing aids are not needed for hearing loss, we can use smartphone apps to generate therapeutic sounds (like broadband noise) to help manage the tinnitus and reduce the contrast of triggering sounds.",
    "It is important to address the emotional connections to these sounds; we recommend a multidisciplinary approach including psychology to help manage the anxiety and reaction to triggers.",
