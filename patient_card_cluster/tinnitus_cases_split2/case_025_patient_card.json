    "Misophonia is not a psychiatric or personality disorder; it is an auditory and neurologically based disorder where sounds are misinterpreted as toxic.",

    "Use the ear-level sound generators to produce white noise that interferes with the trigger sounds.",
    "Engage in proprioceptive activities (like lifting hand weights or using a hand gripper) to help lower your nervous system arousal.",
    "Try to separate the sound from the person; it is the acoustic signal that is the trigger, not the person (e.g., your father) themselves.",
