Tinnitus is high-pitched (9 kHz), tonal, and reactive to masking (positive residual inhibition), causing severe distress and psychological impact.",

    "Your hearing loss pattern and history are consistent with Meniere's Disease, which also explains the changes in your hearing levels over the last year.",
    "The high-pitched ringing you hear is likely related to the hearing loss in the high frequencies, potentially exacerbated by your history of noise exposure.",
    "Although the ringing is severe, testing shows that sound therapy (masking) can provide temporary relief (residual inhibition), suggesting you are a good candidate for combination hearing aids/maskers.",
    "We will work closely with your mental health providers to ensure you are supported while we manage the hearing and tinnitus symptoms."
