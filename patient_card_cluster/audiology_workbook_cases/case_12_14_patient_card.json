Objective testing shows normal middle ear function and robust outer hair cell function (normal DPOAEs), but the ABR at high intensity (80 dB nHL) is abnormal/dys-synchronous. This constellation of findings (Present OAEs + Abnormal ABR) is consistent with Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD).",

    "This means her inner ear (cochlea) is receiving sound normally, as shown by the OAE test, but the signal is not being sent synchronously along the hearing nerve to the brain.",
    "Because of this, sound may be audible but distorted, making speech understanding difficult, especially in background noise.",
