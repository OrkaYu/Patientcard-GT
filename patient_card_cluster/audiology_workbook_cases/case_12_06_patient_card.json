Word recognition is excellent in the left ear when presented at suprathreshold levels (94% at 85 dB HL). Middle ear function is abnormal in the left ear, evidenced by a Type Ad tympanogram (Ytm 5.9 mmhos) and a reflectance dip at 300-800 Hz. The negative Stenger test supports the validity of the left-sided hearing loss, consistent with the reported trauma.",

    "Your hearing test confirms a moderate hearing loss in your left ear, likely related to the recent injury.",
    "The tests for your middle ear system show abnormalities consistent with a conductive loss.",
    "We performed a specialized test called the Stenger test, which confirms that your hearing loss is genuine.",
    "Given your history of loud music exposure, it is critical to protect your hearing in both ears, but especially your 'good' right ear, from further noise damage.",
