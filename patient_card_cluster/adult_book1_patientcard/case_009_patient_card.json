While tympanometry is normal (Type A), acoustic reflexes are absent, and a distinct Carhart notch is visible at 2000 Hz in bone conduction thresholds. Speech understanding remains excellent when volume is sufficient. These findings, combined with the specific configuration of the air-bone gaps, are classic audiological indicators of otosclerosis.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test shows a 'mixed' hearing loss, meaning there is a problem with how sound travels through the middle ear bones, in addition to some inner ear wear.",
    "The specific pattern we see (a dip in the bone conduction hearing at 2000 Hz and absent reflexes) strongly suggests a condition called otosclerosis, where the stirrup bone gets stuck.",
    "Even though you have a history of noise exposure, the primary cause of your current difficulty appears to be this middle ear condition.",
    "We are referring you to an otologist (ear specialist) to discuss medical options, which may include surgery to fix the middle ear bone or hearing aids.",
    "Given your noise exposure history, you should continue to wear hearing protection at work to prevent further damage to the inner ear."

    "You have had ringing in your ears (tinnitus) for 3 years.",
    "You feel a bit off-balance sometimes.",
    "You are open to surgery if it will fix the problem, as you perceive the left ear to be worse."
