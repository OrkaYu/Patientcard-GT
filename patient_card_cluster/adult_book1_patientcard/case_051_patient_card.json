  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient has a flat 60 dB HL sensorineural hearing loss and was unsuccessfully fitted with low-power RIC devices (C4-Passion) which had insufficient OSPL90 (108 dB SPL) compared to his previous BTEs (125 dB SPL). This resulted in saturation/clipping of loud speech peaks, causing muffled sound and significantly degraded speech-in-noise performance (+2 dB SNR on HINT). Comparative testing demonstrated that a higher-power RIC (C4-FS) restored and slightly improved performance (-3 dB SNR).",
  "counseling_points": [
    "The 'muffled' sound you are experiencing is because the smaller C4-Passion hearing aids cannot handle the loud peaks of speech, effectively 'clipping' the sound.",
    "Your previous hearing aids had a much higher maximum power output (OSPL90), which your hearing loss requires for clarity in noise.",
    "We recommend switching to the Clear Fusion (C4-FS) model with a power receiver. It is still cosmetically discreet but provides the power necessary to match the loudness and clarity of your previous devices.",
    "Our testing shows the Fusion model improves your ability to hear in noise by roughly 30-50% compared to the Passion model you are currently trying."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "You are an engineer, so you are analytical and understand technical explanations, but you are also very conscious of cosmetics.",
    "You are frustrated that 'newer technology' sounds worse than your 10-year-old hearing aids.",
    "Describe the sound in noise as 'mingled'—you can hear sound, but you can't separate the speech from the background."
