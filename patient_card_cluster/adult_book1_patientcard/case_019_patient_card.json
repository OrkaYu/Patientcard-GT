Key indicators include absent acoustic reflexes, present and robust OAEs, and absent/degraded ABR waveforms. Functionally, this results in severe difficulty understanding speech in noise and temporal processing deficits, explaining why amplification exacerbates the signal-to-noise problem.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing difficulty is not just about volume (sensitivity) but about how the nerve sends timing information to the brain (synchrony). This is called Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD).",
    "This condition explains why hearing aids help in quiet (making sounds louder) but hurt in noise (amplifying the 'blur' or distortion).",
    "We recommend medical clearance with an otologist and neurologist.",
    "For management, visual communication strategies are crucial. You may continue using hearing aids in quiet if helpful, but removing them in noise is a valid strategy.",
    "Cochlear implants are a potential treatment option to consider if difficulties persist, as they can bypass the dyssynchronous part of the ear."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "Portray frustration specifically regarding the hearing aids in noise—emphasize that they make the background noise 'mix' with the speech, making it impossible to understand.",
    "You are motivated and cooperative but confused why the devices that were supposed to help are making things worse in social situations.",
    "Mention the 'buzzing' tinnitus but note it is infrequent."
