Switching to custom earmolds allowed for successful matching of NAL-NL1 targets and improved physical comfort.",

    "Because of your hearing loss configuration, 'open domes' leak too much sound, causing feedback (whistling) before we can give you the volume you need.",
    "To hear speech clearly in noise, we need to boost the high pitches (3000–4000 Hz). Only custom earmolds can seal the ear well enough to reach those targets.",
    "Although custom molds cost more initially, they provide better retention, comfort, and the necessary gain for your specific hearing loss.",

    "You are a professional (attorney) who is articulate but struggling in meetings.",

    "However, after trying the domes for 2 weeks, you found them uncomfortable and not helpful enough.",
    "In the final visit, express relief that the custom molds actually feel better and sound better."
