The left ear, despite normal thresholds and speech scores, shows abnormal ABR latencies due to a large CPA tumor.",

    "Your hearing tests and MRI confirm a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), involving tumors on the hearing nerves of both sides.",
    "The hearing loss and 'rollover' (difficulty understanding speech at loud volumes) in your right ear are caused by the tumor affecting the nerve's ability to transmit sound clearly.",
    "Although your left ear currently hears well, the ABR test and MRI show a tumor is present there as well, which requires careful monitoring.",
