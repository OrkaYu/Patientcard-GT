Over a 3-year period, the air-bone gaps in the left ear widened, correlating with worsening vestibular symptoms and the emergence of Tullio phenomenon.",

    "Your hearing test shows a 'false' conductive hearing loss; the inner ear is actually hypersensitive to bone-conducted sound due to a thinning of the bone covering the superior canal.",

    "The 'third window' created by the missing bone allows pressure to leak from the inner ear, which explains why you feel dizzy when you hear loud noises or strain.",
