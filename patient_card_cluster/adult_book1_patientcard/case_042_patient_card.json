Initial hearing aid fitting using predicted ear canal acoustics (RECD) resulted in under-amplification and patient disappointment. Investigation revealed his ear canals are smaller than average (higher measured RECD), requiring specific programming adjustments to achieve optimal audibility (AI 0.89 vs 0.74).",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your ear canals are smaller than the 'average' ear, which changes how sound behaves inside them.",
    "Because we initially used an average prediction, your hearing aids were not giving you quite enough volume in the pitch ranges critical for speech.",
    "By measuring your specific ear canal acoustics, we can adjust the hearing aids to provide the exact amount of sound you need.",
