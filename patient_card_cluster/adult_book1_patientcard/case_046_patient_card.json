Despite excellent word recognition in quiet, the unaided Speech Intelligibility Index is low (14%).

    "Your hearing loss is concentrated in the high frequencies, which explains why speech isn't clear in noise and why high piano notes sound 'thin'.",
    "The 'flat' sound you hear when playing C# is called dyplacusis. This happens when damage to the inner ear causes the pitch to be perceived incorrectly.",
    "We believe the distortion is coming from the harmonics of the note, rather than the fundamental note itself.",
    "To fix this, we have programmed a 'notch' in your hearing aids to reduce amplification specifically in the 1000–1500 Hz range. This removes the distorted information while keeping other sounds audible."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "You are a knowledgeable amateur musician. You know your piano is in tune, so you are confused and frustrated that it sounds 'flat'.",

    "You have a history of noise exposure (guns, work), so you might expect some hearing loss, but the pitch distortion is the most bothersome symptom."
