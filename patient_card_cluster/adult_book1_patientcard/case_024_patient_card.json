  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient presents with a patent PE tube in the right ear and normal hearing in the left ear. Initial testing with insert earphones suggested a worsening of low-frequency conductive hearing loss in the right ear post-surgery. However, re-evaluation using supra-aural headphones revealed significantly better low-frequency thresholds (15 dB improvement at 250 and 500 Hz). The discrepancy confirms that the use of insert earphones in an ear with a patent PE tube (low impedance) resulted in an artifactual loss of sound pressure level in the ear canal, leading to inaccurate 'worse' thresholds.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "The 'worsening' of hearing you were told about was actually a measurement error caused by the type of earplugs used during the test.",
    "Because you have a tube in your eardrum, the foam earplugs (insert earphones) let some sound escape or lose energy differently than headphones that sit over your ears.",
    "When we tested you with the over-the-ear headphones, your hearing levels were better and matched what we expect for an ear with a tube.",
    "Your tube is open and working correctly to keep air in the middle ear.",
