This is evidenced by the presence of robust DPOAEs and Cochlear Microphonics (indicating normal outer hair cell function) alongside absent ABR, absent acoustic reflexes, and poor speech recognition. Cortical responses (LLR) are present at mild levels, suggesting sound reaches the cortex despite the dys-synchrony at the brainstem level.",

    "Your testing shows a condition called Auditory Neuropathy. This means the inner ear organ is working, but the nerve connection to the brain is not firing in a synchronized way.",

    "The condition may be related to the recent infections and treatments you have undergone.",
    "Traditional hearing aids may be of limited help because making sound louder does not always make it clearer for this condition, but we can explore trial options or assistive listening devices."

    "You are lucid but physically weak (wheelchair, IV lines).",
    "You are motivated by potential disability income, so you may seem slightly defensive if challenged, but the hearing difficulty is real (neuropathic)."
