    "However, when speech is played, you accidentally respond at softer levels (55 dB) because speech is easier to recognize.",
    "During the Stenger test (when sounds play in both ears at once): If you hear the sound in your 'bad' (left) ear, do NOT respond, even if you can also hear it in your 'good' ear. This is the 'Stenger effect' that gives you away."
