Evaluation revealed the patient was using inappropriate device settings (high volume, low sensitivity), which compressed the dynamic range and reduced audibility of soft sounds. When tested with these user settings, performance was poor (30% CI-only in quiet). Restoring recommended settings (Volume 5, Sensitivity 12) resulted in clinically significant improvements in both quiet (72% CI-only) and noise (normal/near-normal SNR loss in Focus program).",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing device settings act like a camera lens; changing the sensitivity too much limits the range of sounds you can hear.",
    "By lowering the sensitivity to 7, you were cutting off soft speech sounds, which is why you felt you were missing conversation.",
    "Increasing the volume to 8 caused louder sounds to be compressed, reducing clarity.",
    "Our testing today proves that returning to the recommended settings (Sensitivity 12, Volume 5) doubles your understanding in quiet and significantly improves your ability to hear in noise.",
