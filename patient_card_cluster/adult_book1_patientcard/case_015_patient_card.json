These retrocochlear signs in the left ear, distinct from the expected cochlear pattern of ototoxicity, indicate a recurrence or progression of the previously treated CPA meningioma.",

    "Your hearing test shows changes in both ears, likely due to the chemotherapy, but the left ear shows specific signs that are concerning for reasons other than the medication.",
    "The 'rollover' in your speech scores (where louder speech becomes harder to understand) and the reflex test results suggest the issue in the left ear is related to the nerve or the previous tumor site, rather than just the inner ear hair cells.",
    "It is critical to obtain a new MRI to check the status of the meningioma, as these results suggest it may be compressing the auditory nerve again.",
