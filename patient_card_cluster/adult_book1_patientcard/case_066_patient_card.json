Despite the degree of loss, word recognition scores are disproportionately poor (50-52% bilaterally), suggesting significant cochlear distortion or retrocochlear involvement (though reflexes/decay were inconclusive/absent). This explains the limited benefit from previous amplification strategies that focused solely on gain.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test shows a mild-to-moderate hearing loss, but more importantly, your ability to understand words is significantly reduced (around 50%).",
    "Because of this 'clarity' issue, simply making sounds louder with hearing aids won't fix the distortion—it's like turning up the volume on a fuzzy radio station.",
    "To help you hear in noise, we are recommending an FM system. This acts like a direct wire from the speaker to your ears, bypassing the background noise.",

    "You are motivated to try new technology (FM system) because you are socially withdrawing (e.g., dining out, playing cards).",
    "You rely heavily on TV captions and are tired of asking people to repeat themselves."
