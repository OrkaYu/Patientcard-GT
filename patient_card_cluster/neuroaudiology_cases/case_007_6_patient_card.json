  "overall_audiologic_summary": "This case involves a 20-year-old female with a severe seizure disorder originating in the left anterior temporal lobe. Pre-operative testing revealed normal peripheral hearing but severe central deficits, manifested as bilaterally depressed dichotic digits scores (15% LE, 25% RE) and absent late auditory evoked potentials. Following a left temporal lobectomy, the patient showed dramatic improvement in auditory processing. Post-operative dichotic digits scores returned to near normal (85% LE, 88% RE), and late potentials (N1, P2, P300) became identifiable, particularly with left ear stimulation. The right ear stimulation (contralateral to the lesion) yielded poorer morphologic responses, suggesting a contralateral ear effect or reduced volume conduction.",

    "Explain that the pre-operative difficulty with verbal directions was likely due to the 'interference' caused by the seizure activity in the auditory areas of the brain.",
    "Highlight the significant improvement in processing speech (dichotic digits) following the surgery.",
    "Discuss that while behavioral scores improved, some electrophysiological responses (especially from the right ear) remain abnormal, reflecting the surgical removal of temporal lobe tissue.",

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "Patient is a young adult (20) who has dealt with seizures her whole life.",
    "She is likely relieved post-surgery as seizures have decreased and she can return to work.",
    "She is cooperative but may have had difficulty with complex tasks (like counting rare stimuli for P300) prior to surgery."
