  "overall_audiologic_summary": "This case presents an unusual manifestation of an acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma). The patient, a 34-year-old female, presented with sudden, fluctuating low-frequency SNHL and normal acoustic reflexes—symptoms typically associated with cochlear hydrops or fistula rather than retrocochlear pathology. However, ABR testing revealed retrocochlear signs (abnormal ILD, extended interwave intervals, and a significant rate shift). Following surgical removal of a 1.4 cm tumor, the patient experienced total hearing loss in the ear, followed by a rare 'late recovery' of some low-to-mid frequency hearing and poor speech recognition several months post-op.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Explain that while the initial symptoms mimicked other inner ear conditions (like fluid fluctuation), the ABR and CT scan confirmed a tumor on the hearing nerve.",
    "Discuss the rarity of the 'late recovery' of hearing observed; typically, hearing lost immediately after this surgery does not return.",
    "Counsel on realistic expectations for the left ear: while sound awareness has returned, speech clarity (24%) is very poor, and the ear will likely not be useful for communication in noise.",
    "Emphasize the importance of protecting the normal right ear."
  ],
  "notes_for_actor": [
    "In the first visit, you are anxious but not dizzy. You feel 'foggy' and frustrated that your hearing keeps changing—some days it's better, some days worse.",
    "You describe the tinnitus as high-pitched and the ear feeling 'full' or 'pressure-filled'.",
    "At the follow-up, you are surprised and pleased that you can hear *something* in the left ear again, even if it isn't clear speech, as you were told it was gone forever immediately after surgery."
