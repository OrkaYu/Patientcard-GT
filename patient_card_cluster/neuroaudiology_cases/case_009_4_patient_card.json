However, neurodiagnostic results indicate significant retrocochlear/brainstem involvement. Key findings include: 1) Absent acoustic reflexes with Right Ear stimulation despite normal hearing; 2) Abnormal ABR, significantly worse in the Right Ear (Wave I only) compared to the Left (Waves I & III present); 3) Abnormal MLD (4 dB) suggesting low brainstem pathology; 4) Central behavioral deficits, particularly on the SSW (Left Ear deficit) and Frequency Patterns (bilateral deficit). The pattern of results (Reflexes, ABR, MLD) strongly suggests brainstem (low pons) involvement, consistent with the patient's MS diagnosis.",
