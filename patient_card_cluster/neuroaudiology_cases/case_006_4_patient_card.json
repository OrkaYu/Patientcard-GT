  "overall_audiologic_summary": "This case presents a mid-30s female with lateral hydrocephalus (enlarged lateral ventricles). Peripheral hearing is largely normal except for a mild low-frequency SNHL in the left ear. However, central auditory testing reveals significant findings: bilateral deficits in dichotic listening and temporal patterning (Frequency Patterns), and a complete absence of the P300 potential despite normal ABR and N1/P2 responses. These findings suggest that the expanded lateral ventricles may have displaced subcortical structures (like the caudate) or exerted pressure on the internal capsule, disrupting the neural networks required for P300 generation and complex auditory processing, without affecting the brainstem pathways.",
