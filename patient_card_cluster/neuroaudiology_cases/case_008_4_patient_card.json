  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient initially presented with bilateral central auditory deficits likely due to diffuse epileptic activity. Following posterior commissurotomy, a classic 'split-brain' auditory pattern emerged: the left ear showed a profound deficit in dichotic listening (due to the inability of left-ear signals to cross from the right hemisphere to the left language dominant hemisphere), while the right ear showed significant improvement (attributed to 'release from central auditory competition'). Frequency pattern recognition degraded bilaterally, indicating the necessity of interhemispheric transfer for this task. The subsequent anterior commissurotomy produced no further changes, confirming that auditory transfer occurs primarily through the posterior portion of the corpus callosum.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Peripheral hearing sensitivity remains normal.",
    "Difficulty will be significant in noisy environments or when different people are speaking to each ear simultaneously.",
    "The left ear will struggle to process speech if there is competing noise, due to the disconnection between the right hemisphere (which receives left ear input) and the left hemisphere (language center).",
    "The improvement in the right ear suggests that the brain is now processing right-ear information more efficiently without interference from the left ear/right hemisphere pathways."

    "Patient is a young adult (22) with a history of lifelong epilepsy.",
    "Cognitive function is slightly below average (IQ 84).",
    "The patient is right-handed.",
    "The patient does not report hearing loss (pure tones are normal), but likely struggles with complex listening tasks."
