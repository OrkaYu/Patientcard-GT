Imaging revealed a large Trigeminal (Vth nerve) Schwannoma compressing the brainstem/CPA. Post-surgical removal resulted in the resolution of hyperacusis and 'rollover', return of acoustic reflexes, and normalization of ABR amplitude ratios (Wave V amplitude increased). Long-term follow-up showed significant latency improvement, suggesting neural plasticity and recovery of the auditory pathway after decompression.",

    "Explain that the hearing loss symptoms (rollover, processing issues) were caused by the tumor compressing the auditory nerve and brainstem, even though the tumor grew from the facial sensation nerve (Trigeminal).",

    "Highlight the positive surgical outcome: preservation of hearing sensitivity and recovery of neural function (reflexes returned, ABR improved).",
    "Address persistent tinnitus: While the tumor is gone, the ringing may persist due to prior nerve stress or central changes, but hyperacusis (sound sensitivity) has resolved."
