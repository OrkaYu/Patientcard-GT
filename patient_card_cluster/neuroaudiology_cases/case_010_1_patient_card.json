  "chief_complaint": "Immediately following my seizure, I could not hear anything at all. Now, I can hear sounds and recognize familiar music, but I still struggle to understand words, especially if there is any background noise or if people speak quickly.",
  "problem_summary": {
    "onset": "Sudden onset of total deafness following a tonic-clonic seizure associated with a second CVA (17 months after first CVA).",
    "course": "Total deafness for 1-2 weeks; faint buzzing at 2 weeks; perception of loud noises at 1 month. Recognition of environmental sounds and familiar music returned around 4 months. Speech perception began returning at 5-7 months (aided by lipreading) and improved gradually over 2 years, though deficits in noise persist.",
    "laterality": "Bilateral central involvement; behavioral deficits worse in the left ear.",
    "associated_symptoms": "Transient dysnomia and dysgraphia (cleared in days); left arm and leg paresis (residual from first CVA); inability to recognize unfamiliar music.",
    "functional_impact": "Severe difficulty understanding speech in noise; reliance on speechreading; inability to appreciate new music.",
    "goals_motivation": "Highly motivated; wife is a speech-language pathologist who assists with auditory training."
