  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient presents with normal peripheral hearing but significant central auditory processing deficits following corpus commissurotomy. Pattern perception (Frequency and Duration) is severely bilaterally impaired, attributed to the disconnection of the right hemisphere (pattern recognition) from the left hemisphere (verbal labeling), compounded by pre-existing right temporal lobe damage. Dichotic testing reveals a 'release from central competition' phenomenon: the right ear scores improved significantly post-surgery (likely due to removal of neural competition), while the left ear scores remained poor or declined due to the blockage of callosal pathways required to transfer left-ear signals to the language-dominant left hemisphere.",

    "Explain that difficulty labeling sound patterns (humming vs naming) is expected due to the separation of the brain hemispheres.",
    "Discuss the 'release from central competition' which has improved hearing performance in the right ear in complex listening environments.",

    "Reassure that standard speech recognition in quiet remains excellent."

    "Patient has a history of severe seizures and has undergone major brain surgery.",
