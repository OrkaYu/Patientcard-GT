Although the patient was aphasic and could not repeat words, he retained the ability to repeat numbers, which allowed for the successful administration of the Dichotic Digits test. Electrophysiologic testing (MLR and Late Potentials) supported the diagnosis by demonstrating an electrode effect consistent with the location of the lesion.",
