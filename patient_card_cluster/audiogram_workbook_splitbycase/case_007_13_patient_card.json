The pattern of absent reflexes in the right ear with normal tympanograms is consistent with a middle ear pathology such as otosclerosis.",

    "You have a 'mixed' hearing loss in your right ear, meaning there is a mechanical blockage preventing sound from reaching the inner ear efficiently, in addition to some natural wear-and-tear.",
    "The specific pattern of your test results (hearing loss with normal eardrum movement but absent reflexes) strongly suggests a condition called Otosclerosis, where a tiny bone in the ear becomes stiff.",
    "We are referring you to an ENT specialist to confirm this diagnosis.",
    "Treatment options include surgery (to fix the stiff bone) or a hearing aid. Both would likely be very effective for you.",
