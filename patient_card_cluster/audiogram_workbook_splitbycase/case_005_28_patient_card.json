    "Your hearing test today is essentially normal. You have excellent ability to understand speech.",
    "The dizziness you are describing—specifically that it happens when you turn over in bed or look up—is very characteristic of a condition called BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo).",
    "This type of dizziness is caused by tiny crystals in the inner ear moving into the wrong canal. It is not related to hearing loss.",
    "I am referring you to an ENT specialist who can perform a simple maneuver (the Epley maneuver) to likely resolve the dizziness.",

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "When describing your dizziness, be very specific that it is triggered by position changes: 'turning over in bed' and 'looking up' (e.g., to a high shelf).",

    "You believe your hearing is fine, but the itchiness is annoying."
