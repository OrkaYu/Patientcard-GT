Acoustic reflexes are absent in the left ear and for contralateral stimulation, supporting the presence of a conductive component.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test confirms a 'conductive' hearing loss in your left ear, which means sound is being blocked from reaching the inner ear nerve.",
    "The 'underwater' sensation and the flat graph on the pressure test (tympanogram) suggest fluid or an issue with the middle ear space, likely related to the trauma.",
    "The nerve of hearing itself appears healthy, as shown by the bone conduction test and your ability to understand speech clearly when it is made loud enough.",
