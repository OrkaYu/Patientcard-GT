  "overall_audiologic_summary": "The patient presents with a bilateral mixed hearing loss, worse in the right ear. The low-frequency conductive component is attributed to Eustachian tube dysfunction (indicated by negative tympanometric pressure) likely secondary to radiation. The high-frequency sensorineural component is consistent with ototoxicity from cisplatin chemotherapy. Speech recognition is reasonably preserved in the left ear but moderately degraded in the right.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing loss has two causes: the medication (cisplatin) has affected the inner ear nerves (high pitches), and the radiation has likely caused some blockage in the tubes behind your eardrums (low pitches).",
    "We are referring you to an ENT specialist first to address the pressure issue in your middle ear.",
    "Once the ENT has managed the middle ear condition, hearing aids will likely be very beneficial for you.",
    "Even though you don't feel pain, the negative pressure we measured explains why some sounds feel 'blocked' or muffled."

  "notes_for_actor": [
    "Portray a patient who is matter-of-fact about their cancer treatment history.",
    "You do not have active ear pain or tinnitus, just a notice that hearing has dropped since treatment.",
