    "Your hearing test shows a 'conductive' hearing loss in your right ear. This means the inner ear nerve is working well, but sound is not being conducted efficiently through the middle ear bones.",
    "Even though your eardrum moves normally (as shown by the pressure test), the bones behind it appear stiff, which prevents sound from getting through.",
    "This condition is consistent with Otosclerosis, a fixation of the stapes bone.",
    "Because the inner nerve is healthy, you have two main options: a surgical procedure to replace the stiff bone (stapedectomy) or using a hearing aid to amplify sound through the blockage.",
