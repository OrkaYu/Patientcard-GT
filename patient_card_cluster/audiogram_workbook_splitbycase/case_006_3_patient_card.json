The conductive loss is consistent with the history of chronic otitis media and tympanomastoidectomy.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your right ear has normal hearing, but your left ear has a 'conductive' hearing loss, meaning the inner ear nerve is working well, but sound isn't getting through the middle ear structures efficiently due to your past surgeries.",
    "Because your word recognition score is excellent (96%) in the left ear, you are a good candidate for a hearing aid, which can make sounds loud enough to overcome that blockage.",
