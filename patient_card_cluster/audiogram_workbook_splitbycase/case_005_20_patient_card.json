Speech understanding is critically compromised; the right ear has no measurable word recognition (only awareness), and the left ear has very poor recognition (16%). Middle ear function is normal, but the severity of the loss precludes most acoustic reflex responses.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing loss is severe to profound, particularly in the right ear where speech clarity is extremely limited.",
    "Because your word recognition score in the better ear is very low (16%), traditional hearing aids may provide volume but might not provide enough clarity for speech understanding.",
    "We should discuss a Cochlear Implant evaluation as a potential option given the severity of the loss and poor speech scores.",
    "If proceeding with hearing aids, assistive devices like a captioned telephone and using visual cues are essential for communication.",
    "Since you own a business, continue utilizing quiet environments for meetings, as background noise will make communication nearly impossible."
  ],
  "notes_for_actor": [
    "You are a business owner who is used to being in control. You have adapted to your hearing loss by strictly controlling your environment (only meeting in quiet places).",
    "You are likely frustrated that your 10-year-old hearing aids aren't working, but you might be hesitant about surgery (Cochlear Implant) initially.",
    "You rely heavily on the 'better' ear (left), but even that one is struggling significantly now."
