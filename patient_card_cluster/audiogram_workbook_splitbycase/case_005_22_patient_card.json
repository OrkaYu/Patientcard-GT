    "Your hearing test confirms a significant drop in high-pitch hearing in your right ear, which explains the sudden difficulty you are experiencing.",

    "The specialist may prescribe steroids to try to recover some hearing and may order an MRI to rule out any underlying causes for the asymmetry.",
