  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test today confirms that your inner ear (nerve) hearing remains normal on both sides.",
    "The hearing loss in your left ear is 'conductive,' meaning sound is not getting through the middle ear system efficiently due to your prior surgeries, which is expected.",
    "Since your word recognition scores are excellent, you are a great candidate to continue using your hearing aid.",
    "Please continue to use hearing protection in noisy environments to protect your inner ear hearing.",
