The left ear shows slight middle ear stiffness (Type As tympanogram), affecting acoustic reflex thresholds, but the primary deficit is sensorineural.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing loss has a unique 'cookie-bite' shape, meaning you hear very low and very high pitch sounds well, but miss the middle pitches where a lot of speech volume is.",
    "Given your family history (mother and grandmother), this pattern is likely genetic.",
    "Because your high-pitch hearing is good, you retain clarity, but voices may sound hollow or lacking volume.",
    "Hearing aids are recommended to boost the mid-range volumes specifically. Receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) style aids would work well to keep your ear canal open for the natural high-pitch hearing you still have."
