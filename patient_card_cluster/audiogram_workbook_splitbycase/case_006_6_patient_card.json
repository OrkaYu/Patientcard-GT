The right ear exhibits a moderate conductive hearing loss with a characteristic Carhart's notch at 2000 Hz, consistent with the patient's history of otosclerosis. Speech understanding remains excellent in the right ear when sound is made loud enough to overcome the conductive component.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test confirms the conductive hearing loss in your right ear is still present and consistent with otosclerosis.",
    "The 'gap' between your nerve hearing (bone conduction) and your total hearing (air conduction) indicates that the inner ear is healthy, but sound is not being conducted efficiently through the middle ear bones.",
    "Because your nerve function is good, you have excellent potential for improvement either through surgery or hearing aids.",
    "We are referring you to an otologist to discuss surgical options (stapedectomy).",
    "If surgery is not chosen or indicated, hearing aids are a very effective option for this type of hearing loss."
