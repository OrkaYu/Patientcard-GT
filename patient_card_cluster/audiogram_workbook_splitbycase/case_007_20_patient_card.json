The right ear exhibits high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, while the left ear shows a complex mixed hearing loss configuration (poorer in lows and highs, better in mids) with significant air-bone gaps despite normal tympanometry. Speech recognition is excellent in the right ear and good in the left ear. Further medical workup (ABR and MRI) ruled out retrocochlear pathology, attributing the loss to presbycusis and genetics.",
  "counseling_points": [
    "Your hearing test confirms that you have hearing loss in both ears, but as you suspected, the left ear is weaker than the right.",
    "The type of hearing loss in your left ear is 'mixed,' meaning there is an issue with both the nerve and the conduction of sound, though your middle ear pressure test was normal.",
    "Because there is a difference between your ears, we obtained medical clearance (MRI) which came back normal, ruling out any growths on the hearing nerve.",
    "You are a good candidate for hearing aids. Using two hearing aids will help balance your hearing and improve your ability to hear in background noise.",
    "We will need to monitor your hearing annually due to the complex nature of the loss."
