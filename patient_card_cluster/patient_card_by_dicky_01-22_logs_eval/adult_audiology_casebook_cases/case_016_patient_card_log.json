The asymmetry, along with left-sided tinnitus and aural fullness, necessitated a medical referral, which ruled out retrocochlear pathology via MRI and ABR. Unaided speech-in-noise testing revealed a moderate SNR loss (14 dB), indicating significant difficulty in background noise that likely requires assistive technology beyond hearing aids alone. Patient was fit with bilateral ReSound LiNX 3D 9 RIC hearing aids and a ReSound Multi Mic. Post-fitting aided QuickSIN improved to 6 dB (mild SNR loss), representing an 8 dB improvement. Aided COSI indicated better or much better performance in all targeted listening situations. Patient reports significant benefit from both hearing aids and Multi Mic at final follow-up."
